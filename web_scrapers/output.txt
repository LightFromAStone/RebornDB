Stat stages.
Moves known (each with 5 PP and a max. PP of 5).
Types.
Ability.
The user's catch rate/Exp yield/IV yield are still those of the original user, not of the species it transformed into. If the user was affected by Disable, it is no longer affected by it.

If that attack has multiple targets, then after the attack has hit targets without Magic Coat/Magic Bounce, targets with Magic Coat/Magic Bounce will each bounce back the attack themselves against all possible targets for them.
This bouncing overrides the ability Soundproof (i.e. if the user has Soundproof and the attack is sound-based, that attack is still bounced back).
The effect ends if the user is switched out.

Code: 0ED
Effect: Replaces the user with a different non-active Pokémon in the user's party (of the user's choice). The replacement Pokémon inherits various things from the user, including stat stages, substitutes and certain other effects. Fails if there is no possible replacement. Ignores trapping moves.

Effect: If this move inflicts damage, and if the user is still active and hasn't fainted and it isn't the end of the battle, replaces the user with a different non-active Pokémon in the user's party (of the user's choice). Ignores trapping moves.
If the target has chosen to use Pursuit this round, but hasn't used it yet, then it will interrupt this move to use it at double damage before this move's user switches out. Pursuit currently doesn't interrupt this move.

Effect: The user gives its held item to the target. Fails if:
The user doesn't have an item.
The target is already holding an item.
The target has a substitute.
The item is a mail item.

Code: 0F4
Effect: After using this move, if the target's held item is a berry and the user has not fainted, the user consumes it and gains its effect (ignoring its trigger conditions). Fails if the item isn't a berry, if the target has a substitute, or if the user has the ability Klutz or is affected by Embargo. The berry is consumed even if the user cannot use items. The berry is lost forever.

Code: 0F5
Effect: If the target's held item is a berry, it is destroyed and lost forever. The berry is not destroyed if the target has a substitute, or the berry was already consumed because of being hit by this move.
Gen 6+: A target's held Gem is also destroyed by this move.

Code: 0F6
Effect: If the user isn't holding an item, the user receives the last item it held and consumed (by its own effect or by Fling/Natural Gift) this battle.
Works even if the consumed item was not originally the user's.

Code: 0F7
Effect: The user drops its held item (even if the attack misses). Base power and effect depend on which item it was. Some items can't be flung (the attack will fail if this is so).
Fails if the user isn't holding an item, or can't use items (i.e. Embargo, the ability Klutz). Fails if the user is an Arceus holding a Plate, or a Giratina holding a Griseous Orb, or a Genesect holding a Drive, or if the item is a Mega Stone the user can use.

Code: 106
Effect: If the user's ally is about to use Fire Pledge or Water Pledge this round, this move does nothing except cause the ally to take their turn next, regardless of priority.
If the user's ally has just used Fire Pledge or Water Pledge in the current round (and thus made this move go immediately next), this move's power is doubled. This move becomes Fire Pledge just for this attack, if the ally's move is Fire Pledge. One of the following effects begins, depending on the other Pledge move:

Fire Pledge: For 4 rounds (including the current round), a sea of fire appears on the target's side. At the end of each round, all Pokémon on the affected side lose HP equal to 1/8 of their max HP.

Grass Pledge: For 4 rounds (including the current round), a sea of fire appears on the target's side. At the end of each round, all Pokémon on the affected side lose HP equal to 1/8 of their max HP.
Water Pledge: For 4 rounds (including the current round), a rainbow appears on the user's side. The probability of attacks used by battlers on the affected side having their secondary effects occurring is doubled (does not stack with the ability Serene Grace).

Code: 108
Effect: If the user's ally is about to use Grass Pledge or Fire Pledge this round, this move does nothing except cause the ally to take their turn next, regardless of priority.
If the user's ally has just used Grass Pledge or Fire Pledge in the current round (and thus made this move go immediately next), this move's power is doubled. This move becomes Grass Pledge just for this attack, if the ally's move is Grass Pledge. One of the following effects begins, depending on the other Pledge move:

Grass Pledge: For 4 rounds (including the current round), a swamp appears on the target's side. The speed of all Pokémon on the affected side is halved (this does not affect stat stages).
Fire Pledge: For 4 rounds (including the current round), a rainbow appears on the user's side. The probability of attacks used by battlers on the affected side having their secondary effects occurring is doubled (does not stack with the ability Serene Grace).

Code: 109
Effect: At the end of the battle, if the player wins and the user belongs to the player, the player will gain an additional amount of money equal to 5 times the user's level (when the attack was used). This amount is affected by the items Amulet Coin and Luck Incense.

Code: 10A
Effect: Ignores the effect of Reflect, Light Screen and Aurora Veil. If successful, ends the effects of Light Screen, Reflect and Aurora Veil on the opposing side. Uses a different animation if the move breaks Light Screen, Reflect or Aurora Veil on the opposing side.

Code: 10B

Code: 10C
Effect: User loses 1/4 of its total HP (rounded down, min. 1 HP), and creates a decoy with that amount of HP. The decoy disappears if the user is switched out. Fails if the user would faint from losing that HP, or if the user already has a decoy.
Gen 6+: Substitutes are bypassed by sound-based moves and by Pokémon with the ability Infiltrator.

Code: 10D
Effect: If the user isn't at least part Ghost type, decreases the user's Speed by 1 stage and increases the user's Attack and Defense by 1 stage each.
If the user is at least part Ghost, the user loses 1/2 of its total HP (even if the user would faint) and curses the target. A cursed battler loses 1/4 of its total HP at the end of each round. The curse disappears if the battler is switched out. Fails if the target is already cursed or is behind a Crafty Shield.
This move has a different animation depending on which of the above effects occurs.

Code: 10E

Effect: If this attack is successful, the following effects end for the user:
Trapping moves.
Being seeded by Leech Seed.
Spikes, Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes (for the user's side).

Code: 111
Effect: When used, simply starts a timer which counts 3 rounds (including the current round). At the end of the last round, if there is a Pokémon in the target's position (which isn't the user), this move proper is used against it (including accuracy check, damage calculation, etc.). Damage calculation considers the user and target as they are when the move proper is used, not when the timer is started. Items can change the attack's damage, and do so during damage calculation.
If the user is switched out at the time when the move proper is used, it is treated as having no ability or held item, no stat stages or any other effects, and its basic type(s) and Special Attack stat.
The effects of Protect/Detect and Endure end before the attack proper occurs. Ignores semi-invulnerability dues to moves like Fly.
Fails immediately if there is already an attack pending against that target's position. Remains in effect even if the user or the target is switched out. The returned attack is considered an attack by the user. Fails when the move proper is used if the user is fainted.

Code: 112
Effect: Increases the user's Defense and Special Defense by 1 stage each, and increases the user's Stockpile count by 1. Fails if the user's Stockpile count is already 3 or greater. The Stockpile count is reset to 0 if the user is switched out.

Code: 113
Effect: Power is 100 multiplied by the user's Stockpile count. Decreases the user's Defense and Special Defense by the amounts they were increased by Stockpile. Then resets the user's Stockpile count to 0.
Fails if the user's Stockpile count is 0.

Code: 114
Effect: The user gains HP depending on its Stockpile count:
(Stockpile count of 1) - 1/4 of total HP.
(Stockpile count of 2) - 1/2 of total HP.
(Stockpile count of 3) - All HP.
Decreases the user's Defense and Special Defense by X stages each, where X is the user's Stockpile count. Then resets the user's Stockpile count to 0. Both of these effects occur even if no HP was gained.
Fails if the user's Stockpile count is 0 or if it wouldn't do anything. Cannot be used if the user is affected by Heal Block.

Code: 115
Effect: Fails if the user was hit by a non-user's damaging move this round.

Code: 116
Effect: Fails if the target did not choose a damaging move this round, or if the target has already moved this round (unless they used Me First).

Code: 117
Effect: This round, if an opponent uses an attack with a target of \"single non-user\", \"single opposing Pokémon\" or \"opposing Pokémon chosen at random\", it is directed towards the user instead of any other Pokémon (unless the user is being affected by Sky Drop). The effect ends if the user is switched out. (Applied before Magic Coat and Magic Bounce.)
Fails if the battle is a single battle.

Code: 118
Effect: For 5 rounds (including the current round), the following effects are applied:
The effects of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, Sky Drop and Telekinesis end for all active Pokémon. (If Bounce, Fly or Sky Drop ends this way for an active Pokémon, or if Sky Drop ends this way for an opponent, that Pokémon skips the turn when it would have used that move.)
The moves Bounce, Fly, High Jump Kick, Jump Kick, Magnet Rise, Sky Drop, Splash and Telekinesis cannot be used.
All immunities to moves/effect because of the ability Levitate, the item Air Balloon or the Flying type are negated.
The evasion of all Pokémon is treated as 2 stages lower than what it actually is.
Fails if this is already in effect.

Code: 119
Effect: For 5 rounds (including the current round), the user is immune to Ground attacks, the effects of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it can switch out/flee despite the ability Arena Trap.
The effect ends if the user is switched out. The effect can be Baton Passed. Fails if Ingrain, Smack Down or this effect is in effect for the user. Cannot be used if Gravity is in effect.

Code: 11A
Effect: For 3 rounds (including the current round), the following effects apply:
Attacks against the target (except OHKO moves) can't fail accuracy checks.
The target is immune to Ground attacks, the effects of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it can switch out/flee despite the ability Arena Trap.
The effect ends if the target is switched out. The effect can be Baton Passed. Fails if Ingrain, Smack Down or this effect is in effect for the target. Cannot be used if Gravity is in effect.

Code: 11B
Effect: Hits the target even if it is in the middle of using Bounce, Fly or Sky Drop, or is under the effect of Sky Drop.

Code: 11C
Effect: Hits the target even if it is in the middle of using Bounce, Fly or Sky Drop, or is under the effect of Sky Drop. Hits the target even if it is airborne or Flying-type and this move is Ground-type (Ground's effectiveness against the Flying type becomes 1x for this move).
If successful, stops the target being airborne (including because of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, Telekinesis, the ability Levitate, and Flying Pokémon) and makes them vulnerable to Ground moves and the ability Arena Trap. Cancels the target's Bounce and Fly. Does not ground a Pokémon using/being affected by Sky Drop or being affected by Roost (although still hits it).
This grounding lasts until the target is switched out.

Code: 11D
Effect: The target moves immediately after the user this round, regardless of priority. Fails if the target has already moved this round.

Code: 11E
Effect: The target moves last this round, regardless of priority. Fails if the target has already moved this round, or if it would move immediately after the user anyway.

Code: 11F
Effect: For 5 rounds (including the current round), for each priority bracket, Pokémon with low Speed use moves before Pokémon with high Speed. This is overridden by the items Quick Claw, Lagging Tail and Full Incense and the ability Stall.
The effect ends immediately if the field is already being affected by this effect.

Code: 120
Effect: The user switches place with its ally. Fails if the battle is a single battle, or if there is no ally. Does not trigger Pursuit.

Code: 121
Effect: The target's Attack (and its Attack stat stages and some other effects) are used instead of the user's Attack to calculate damage.

Code: 122
Effect: The target's Defense (and its Defense stat stages and other effects that modify its Defense) are used instead of the target's Special Defense to calculate damage.

Code: 123
Effect: This attack is only effective against battlers that share a type with the user. Type effectiveness still applies, though.

Code: 124
Effect: For 5 rounds (including the current round), any effects (including damage calculation) that refer to a Pokémon's Defense instead refer to its Special Defense, and vice versa. Stat stages remain unaffected.

Code: 130
Effect: The user takes recoil damage equal to 1/2 of its current HP (min. 1 damage).

Code: 131

Code: 158
Effect: If the user has not consumed a berry previously in the battle, this move cannot be chosen to be used (similar to trying to choose a move prevented by Taunt). This move can be used even if the consumed berry is restored somehow (e.g. Recycle, Pickup, Harvest).
The berry can be one held by the user and consumed by its effect, or an opponent's berry consumed by the user's Bug Bite/Pluck, or an opponent's berry thrown at the user by Fling.

Code: 15E

Code: 165
Effect: If the target has already performed its action this turn, its ability is negated while it remains in battle. This only applies if this move doesn't miss or the target is immune to it or protected from it.

Code: 166
Effect: Power is doubled if the last move the user used failed or had no effect. Doesn't apply if that move was protected against.

Code: 167
Effect: For 5 rounds (including the current round), the power of all attacks (that are not critical hits, confusion damage or fixed damage) against any Pokémon on the user's side is halved (in single battles) or reduced by 1/3 (in double battles). This reduction does not stack with Light Screen or Reflect.
Fails if the user's side is already being affected by this effect. Fails if the weather is not hail or an effect is negating the weather's effect (e.g. Air Lock).
(Removed by Brick Break, Defog and Psychic Fangs.)

Code: 168
Effect: For the rest of this round, the user is unaffected by any non-user's attacks which have the \"B\" flag (i.e. is affected by Protect/Detect). Fails if this is the last attack used this round.
If the effect of this move blocks an attack that makes contact, the attacker becomes poisoned.
A variable \"X\" starts at 1, and resets to 1 if this attack fails, or if the user uses an attack that isn't Baneful Bunker, Detect, Endure, King's Shield, Protect, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield or Wide Guard. This attack has a 1/X chance of succeeding. \"X\" is doubled each time this attack is successful.
(Feint, Phantom Force, Shadow Force, Hyperspace Hole, and Hyperspace Fury will bypass this move's effect and erase it.)

Code: 169
Effect: This move's type is the same as the user's first type.

Code: 16A
Effect: This round, the target becomes the centre of attention, and all other targeting moves by the target's foes are forced to target it instead of the intended target. This effect overrides all other forms of target redirection such as Follow Me, Storm Drain and Ally Switch.
Fails if the battle is a single battle.

Code: 16B
Effect: The target is forced to repeat its most recent move immediately after this move, with the same target it had the first time.
Fails if the target has not used a move before, or is in the middle of using a multi-turn move, a move that forces its repeated use, or Bide, Focus Punch, Beak Blast or Shell Trap. Fails if the move to be used has no PP left, it is a move that calls another move, or if the target does not know the move.
Moves that fail if used after the Pokémon's first turn in battle will fail when repeated by this move, even if it is still within the Pokémon's first turn.

Code: 16C
Effect: The target cannot user sound-based moves for 2 turns after this one.

Code: 16D
Effect: The user gains 2/3 of its total HP in a sandstorm, or 1/2 of its total HP if not in a sandstorm.

Code: 16E
Effect: The target gains 2/3 of its total HP in Grassy Terrain, or 1/2 of its total HP otherwise. Fails if its HP is full or it has a substitute. Cannot be used if the user is affected by Heal Block.
(Similar to 0DF.)

Code: 16F
Effect: This move's effect depends on which Pokémon it targets:
A foe: Deals damage.
An ally: The target gains 1/2 of its total HP. Fails if the target is affected by Heal Block.
If the user is affected by Heal Block, it cannot choose an ally as this move's target.

Code: 170
Effect: The user takes damage equal to half of its total HP (rounded up), unless it has Magic Guard. This happens even if the target protects itself or is immune or the move misses, but not if there are no targets. This is not recoil damage. It only happens for the first hit of this move (if Parental Bond makes it hit twice).
Fails if there is a Pokémon with the ability Damp on the field.

Code: 171
Effect: Shows an animation and a message at the start of the attack phase to say: \"PKMN set a shell trap!\" Fails if the user has not been hit by an opponent's physical move this round.

Code: 172
Effect: Shows an animation and a message at the start of the attack phase to say: \"PKMN started heating up its beak!\" The user charges up this move from the beginning of this round. Pokémon that make contact with the user in this time become burned.

Code: 173
Effect: Creates a psychic terrain, which lasts for 5 rounds (including the current round). It has the following effect:
Psychic-type moves used by non-airborne Pokémon do 50% more damage.
Pokémon that are not airborne and not semi-invulnerable cannot be hit by an opponent's move with >0 priority. (Doesn't apply to moves that don't specifically target the Pokémon.)
This effect replaces other terrains if they are in effect.
(Nature Power, Secret Power and Camouflage change their effects depending on this terrain.)

Code: 174
Effect: Fails if it isn't the user's first round in the battle.

Code: 175
Effect: Hits 2 times in a row. Causes the target to flinch. Inflicts double damage and has perfect accuracy if the target is Minimized.
